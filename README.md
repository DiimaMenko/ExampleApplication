# HomeListsHelper
The app is designed to create and manage any lists you want.
For the first release, it is planned to create the next minimum of features:
  1. Create, manage, set parameters, and categorize any items to be later added to lists.
  2. Create and manage lists you want, like shopping or to-do lists. Make summaries about each list based on the items' parameters set (like total cost, weight, etc).
  3. Select pictures for items, categories, and lists from the proposed set of predefined images.
  4. Host all the things using a cloud environment.
  5. User profile management. Set name, surname, profile photo, etc. Also, some ways of data deletion are considered.

In the long run, it is planned also to create an API. This will allow us to:
  - create a mobile app
  - create a desktop app
  - create widgets

Other features that are in mind and can be developed later.
  - Add AI to recognize items from the list (for example, fridge content) and mark all the items that are missed. The main use case is to make regular shopping sessions more comfortable.
  - Add specific calculators, like a calorie calculator.
  - Add automatic parameters set from typical values or maybe AI recognition.
